    <h1>Welcome to Page 2</h1>
    <p>This is the second page of my website.</p>

    <p> I used to really enjoy spicy food when I was a kid. However, due to an eventful trip in high school, I am no longer able to eat spicy food.
        This is such a shame because I loved eating spicy food so much. Especially since most Asian cultures, like Thai, Chinese, and Burmese,
        revolve around extremely spicy dishes and flavorful cuisines. To this day, I am still training my palate to return back to normal so I
        can indulge myself in spicy meals again. In Boston, there are some places that remind me of the spicy dishes from back home. Thai and
        Chinese restaurants like 5 Spices, Rod Thai, Thai Basil, and Rod D are just a few of the superb restaurants for Asian cuisine that offer dishes
        filled with rich flavors that are quite literally eye-opening. Though I can only eat the mildest spice range of every dish, I
        am still somewhat able to enjoy the delicious dishes from the restaurants, which provide an array of flavors that tantalize my taste buds.
        I often find myself reminiscing about the bold flavors and heat I used to relish, hoping to one day return
        to enjoying spicy food fully again.
    </p>
