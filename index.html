    <h1>WELCOME TO MY WEBSITE</h1>

    <p> One of my favorite hobbies include cooking. Researching on YoutubeShorts to find a delicious, healthy recipe,
        buying the ingredients, following the recipe step by step carefully to make sure the final product's flavor
        stays true, and finally being able to feast on the food that you put so much effort and trust into. Ever since I
        was a kid, I loved eating food. Thankfully, my parents were always willing to provide me yummy food from time to
        time from the best restaurants in the city back home. The image below is one of my favorite dishes. It resembles
        Kung Pao Chicken in America, but in my opinion, the version from home is betterâ€”though I might be biased.
    </p>

    <p>As you can see the dish looks similar to Kung Pao Chicken but the taste and smell differs vastly. I have been
    trying to cook more recipes that are healthier but also nutritious. Because I enjoy working out and exercising,
    I figured taking care of my diet should come with taking care of my body. One of the most recent dishes that
    I have experimented with was the Boiled Chicken Drumsticks that I found on Youtube. This recipe is great for me
    since each drumstick contains a lot of protein but also a decent amount of calories. It is more of a Chinese
    Recipe since I just prefer to eat more "Asian" meals. </p>
